            <p class="text">According to Italian food scientist Dario Bressanini, the chemical reaction that people see most frequently in their kitchens is the The Maillard reaction. Bressanini says that this reaction can be seen every time we bake or roast something, like fish, vegetables or even marshmallows. What happens here is, due to the absence of water, the sugars and proteins inside the ingredients create a mixture of molecules at high temperatures, hence the golden brown color that we typically see in Thanksgiving turkey. Now you know how to put some science into your cooking! The golden brown color is a signature parameter of a delicious turkey, so next time you roast, remember the Maillard reaction!</p>
