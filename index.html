                <p class="text">Ahh… Thanksgiving. The season of family, warmth, and laughter. The time of turkey, ham, and cranberry sauce. No matter how you celebrate Thanksgiving in the US, you will undoubtedly practise at least some of the common holiday traditions. However, the good ‘ole American way is not the only way of celebrating this holiday (Oooh, that rhymes!). Many countries around the world celebrate giving thanks in their own unique way, and while Thanksgiving may not be a national holiday in some of them, there are equivalents to this family celebration. </p>

                <p>We all know the origin of Thanksgiving, and we heard the stories of the colonists and their first 	celebration of a plentiful harvest, but what if I told you that the holiday wasn’t invented in the US? That’s right - Canada’s “Thanksgiving” was held 40 years before the colonists’ original gathering, according  to an article by Sarah Pruitt on history.com. The English navigator Martin Frobisher threw a big celebration (now known as Nunavut) to give thanks for the safety of the crew that went with him on his expeditions. Pretty exciting!

                <p>Erntedankfest is one of Germany’s many national holidays. Similar to Thanksgiving, this celebration is held as a way of giving thanks for a good harvest season. Instead of preparing a roasted turkey, a typical celebration table would always have a Masthühnchen (which translates to fattened chickens). 
                    Other Erntedankfest dishes include thüringer klösse (Potato Dumplings), cream rolls, and red cabbage, just to name a few. According to Sarah Pruitt, Erntedankfest is celebrated “on the first Sunday in October.” 
                    (Pruitt, Section 2).

            <section class="text">
                <p>Liberia was established by freed American slaves in the early nineteenth century. Thanks to the American Colonization Society, Thanksgiving became a National holiday in the country sometime in the 1880’s. While Liberians don’t bring Turkey or mashed potatoes to their tables, they do prepare roast Chicken and mashed cassavas. Other dishes include beans & rice, pumpkin soup, and everybody’s American favorite, green bean casserole.</p>
