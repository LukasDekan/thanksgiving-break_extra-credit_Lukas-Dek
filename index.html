            <p class="text">Ahh… Thanksgiving. The season of family, warmth, and laughter. The time of turkey, ham, and cranberry sauce. No matter how you celebrate Thanksgiving in the US, you will undoubtedly practise at least some of the common holiday traditions. However, the good ‘ole American way is not the only way of celebrating this holiday (Oooh, that rhymes!). Many countries around the world celebrate giving thanks in their own unique way, and while Thanksgiving may not be a national holiday in some of them, there are equivalents to this family celebration. </p>
