            <p class="hero_text">A Global Feast</p>
            <p class="text">The first thing we think of when it comes to Thanksgiving foods in America is the good ‘ole Thanksgiving Turkey. The fat, roasted bird, fuming with aromatic herbs and spices, with that slight crunch from the turkey skin… it makes my mouth water just thinking about it. There are, of course, a ton of other Thanksgiving foods that Americans typically bring to the table, but what does a plentiful harvest look like in other cultures? If you’re looking for something less traditional to prepare for this holiday season, you’ve come to the right place. This page will give you some fun recipes for three different dishes that you can prepare for you and your family to enjoy together.</p>

            <p class="hero_text">Lasagna, Italy</p>
            <p class="text">Many Italian families that moved to the US in the 20th century began to bring their iconic cuisine into the country. This is why famous restaurants like Pizza Hut and Olive Garden are a thing in America. However, as the influx of Italian immigration kept rising, many Italian families also began to bring American traditions into their homes in the US. One such Tradition is celebrating Thanksgiving, but with the addition of Lasagna. Yes, you heard that right: Italian immigrants bring Lasagna onto their Thanksgiving tables, and it actually makes a lot of sense, considering the fact that it can be a hearty dish to feed the entire family.</p>

            <p class="hero_text">Pumpkin Empanadas, Mexico.</p>
            <p class="text">Similar to how Italian Immigrants brought lasagna as a Thanksgiving tradition, Mexican Americans added this amazing dessert to the holiday table. According to New York Times reporter Christina Morales, the origin of Pumpkin Empanadas comes from Reynosa, Mexico, a town sitting at the border of the US, in the 1800’s. After every halloween, an old lady named Jesusita Soza would take her rain-soaked jack-o-lanterns into her home and cook them up to make a delicious stew. Then, she would fill empanada dough with the stew, and thus the amazing Mexican desert, the pumpkin empanada, was created.</p>

            <p class="hero_text">Hasselback Potatoes, Sweden</p>
            <p class="text">Many people know about Hasselback potatoes, but most Americans don’t know the origins of this Swedish delight. The story of this dish can be traced back to the 1950’s, according to food photographer Leah Maroney. It was invented at a restaurant called “Hasselbacken”, yet the word “Hasselback” has nothing to do with this dish, nor does it have anything to do with its cooking process. This word is actually a combination of two Swedish terms: “hassel” and “back”, and these translate to “hazel” and “slope,” since this restaurant was located near a hazel thicket which grew on a mountain slope.</p>
